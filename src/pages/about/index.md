I am a Frontend Web Developer and Product Engineer specialising primarily in React, Javascript and CSS3. I am interested in a number of emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain / cryptocurrency trading, however my core interest is virtual reality on the web (webVR).

This blog will also feature the regular posting of new interactive timelines built with timelineJS on a number of wide-ranging historical periods.

Before deciding to switch careers to technology and web development, I was a reporter in London, and worked
as a freelance journalist in Israel and the West Bank.

In 2013 I was nominated for the BBC Student Innovation Award as a result of my work on "Drone Journalism".

Check back here for regular updates on webVR and new timelines on a number of wide-ranging historical periods
and subjects.

This blog was built with Gatsby JS and Netlify, a new blogging system which incorporates two popular web technologies - React and Graphql. Gatsby JS generates fast and lightweight "static" pages while Netlify provides a clean and intuitive CMS user interface for non-technical users.
