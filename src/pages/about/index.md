I am a Frontend Web Developer and Product Engineer specialising primarily in React, Javascript and CSS3. I will be writing about everything from how to get started with basic machine learning to scraping data from wikipedia and cryptocurrency trading.

But my main interest is virtual reality on the web or "webVR". I will document my attempts to build VR with compelling use-cases in the elusive search for that "killer app" which could bring VR into the mainstream.

This blog will also feature the regular posting of new interactive timelines built with timelineJS on a number of wide-ranging historical periods.

Before deciding to switch careers to technology and web development, I was a reporter in London, and worked as a freelance journalist in Israel and the West Bank.

In 2013 I was nominated for the BBC Student Innovation Award as a result of my work on "Drone Journalism".

This blog was built with Gatsby JS and Netlify, a new blogging system which incorporates two popular web technologies - React and Graphql. Gatsby JS generates fast and lightweight "static" pages while Netlify provides a clean and intuitive CMS user interface for non-technical users.
